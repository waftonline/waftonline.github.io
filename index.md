## WAFTonline ##  Women Are Fuck Toys

##About WAFTonline##
I miss the good old days of pornography; when pornography used to be on film (even when the industry converted to VHS).  There was an element of secrecy to it.  It was naughty and it took effort to be naughty.  Porn today isn't bad; it's just that it used to be better.

Too often modern porn focuses on the mechanical.  It fucks "18 year old teens," or there's a website where some guy films blowjobs in HD, or the weird porn site where the draw was the guy cumming inside some girls eyes.  Visually pleasing for sure.  In its own way, pornography today is beautiful in that it caters to the most niche fetish out there.  It appeals to literally everyone.  But... it's still largely missing something.

During the golden age (and silver age) of pornography, directors, producers, and actors understood a fundamental element of what made the medium great.  Simply:  that the largest and most important sex organ, is the human brain.  We need a story to give context to the mechanical fucking we see.  Porn is meant to be fantasy.  Porn is meant to be ridiculous.  Porn is meant to be "taboo."  I yearn for those days again.

I created this website for two reasons.  First, I take porn and try to provide a story.  My main goal is to share my work.  Second, if any porn producers happen to stumble upon my work, and want to give me a shot at directing, I'd love to be given a chance to produce pornographic art.

I am on reddit as /u/waftonline and on imagefap as "waftonline." I am also available as a consultant and editor.  Please email at waftonline@gmail.com to hire me for freelance work.
